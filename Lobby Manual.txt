Rocket Lobby System Manual
============================
This manual is here to answer any questions and provide means of contact!
Please report any bugs you find in the Lobby System if something fails to work.
Be sure to read below before making any reports!



====I tried to join a game, and it sent me this document instead====

This is intentional. There are two reasons as to why you cannot join a game right now.

>> Reason 1: You are already in a game.
If you are already in-game, you will not be allowed to join any other games. This is an
anti-spam measure. This will prevent people from making hundreds of lobbies for no reason. Plus
it's just a way to ensure you don't play two different games that have similar controls.

>> Reason 2: You left in the middle of a running game.
The Lobby System that this bot uses is designed to keep track of any players who are in a game.
When a game ends, the lobby system will set your "in-game" flag to false. This way, you can join
a new game. However, if the bot designer decided to allow users to leave in the middle of a game,
this lobby system will not set your "in-game" flag until the game you left is finished.

This is done on purpose. It will serve as a "cooldown" for however long the game will last. Leaving
games can be frustrating to other players because it often times disrupts the flow of the game
you were originally playing. This cooldown should not last very long. Try again in 1-3 minutes and
it should work just fine.




===Why didn't I join a game?====

If the very first thing you do when you get on discord is attempt to use this bot, chances are the
first request to join a game will not go through successfully. The Lobby System dynamically adds
new users as they send messages in servers that the bot resides in.

In other words, you have to send a message to be added into the Lobby's system. Normally people
already begin conversations within servers before playing around with discord bots, so you will 
usually never encounter this problem. However, if you do ever send a request that doesn't go
through, just try again. You should be added into the system by now.




====For some reason the last input I made is being re-used on the next turn with this game====

If you inserted a command for a game like "roll again" that was automatically re-used when it
became your turn, this has nothing to do with this Lobby System. The inputs you give are handled
by the lobby system, but clearing the inputs are done through the bot designer. If you are having
this issue, I recommend you contact the person who designed this bot and inform them of this bug.
There's a good chance they forgot to clear user inputs every turn.




====This game bugged out for some reason====

Any games that were made by the bot designer were completely developed by the designers themselves.
The Lobby System is only responsible for handling lobbies, RAM, users, and inputs. Any game related
bug needs to be brought up to the bot designer, not to me (Rocket, the developer of the Lobby System)
